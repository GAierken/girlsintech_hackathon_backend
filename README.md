## Volunteer app backend for hackathon


The backend RESTful API service is built with Ruby on Rails powered by PostgreSQL. It is designed with self referential association for improving the query speed and avoiding the extra unneeded models. To persist and maintain database, the validations are implemented. For security management, the backend is developed with JSON Web Token, bcrypt and dotenv-rails.The Heroku platform was chosen to host because itâ€™s quick to provision and quick to deploy.
